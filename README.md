# Dagla, Intelligent Vehicle
##Introduction
The Intelligent Vehicle project, developed by Glanda Darie and Teofil Dagla, is an innovative system designed to showcase intelligent features in a vehicle. This documentation provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, features, and implementation details.

## Features
Hand Gesture Detection: The system incorporates hand gesture detection to enable intuitive control of the vehicle's functions. Users can perform gestures such as swipes or taps to interact with the vehicle's interface.

Autonomous Driving: The Intelligent Vehicle is equipped with an autopilot feature that enables autonomous driving. Using computer vision and machine learning algorithms, the vehicle can navigate and make decisions based on the surrounding environment.

Acceleration Test: The system includes a test module to evaluate the vehicle's acceleration capabilities. Users can initiate an acceleration test, and the vehicle gradually increases its speed to measure its performance.

Direction Selection Test: Another test module allows users to select a specific direction for the vehicle. This test evaluates the vehicle's responsiveness and accuracy in following user-selected directions.

Software Testing: The software component of the Intelligent Vehicle undergoes rigorous testing to ensure proper functionality. Tests focus on validating input fields, such as time durations, in the mobile application and website interfaces.

## Hardware Components
DC Motors: The Intelligent Vehicle utilizes DC motors for its propulsion system. These motors provide the necessary torque and speed control for efficient vehicle movement.

External Battery: To power the system, an external battery with a capacity of 10,000 mAh is employed. The battery ensures sufficient power supply for extended operation periods.

L298N Motor Driver: The L298N motor driver module is responsible for controlling and driving the DC motors. It allows for precise motor control and direction selection.

HC-05 Bluetooth Module: The HC-05 module facilitates wireless communication between the vehicle and external devices, such as smartphones or tablets. It enables seamless interaction and control of the vehicle through a Bluetooth connection.

## Software Environment
The software component of the Intelligent Vehicle project utilizes the following technologies:

Programming Language: The system is primarily developed using Python, a versatile and widely used programming language.

Libraries and Frameworks: Various libraries and frameworks are employed, including OpenCV for computer vision tasks, TensorFlow for machine learning, and Flask for web application development.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Popular IDEs such as PyCharm, Thonny, and Visual Studio Code are utilized for code development, debugging, and project management.

## Conclusion and Future Development
The Intelligent Vehicle project showcases a range of intelligent features, from hand gesture detection to autonomous driving. The current implementation provides a solid foundation, but there is room for further development. Future enhancements may include the acquisition of a Raspberry Pi board with 8 GB RAM to improve video processing speed and accuracy in signal detection.

The project's documentation and code are available on GitHub, providing an opportunity for collaboration and contributions from the open-source community.
